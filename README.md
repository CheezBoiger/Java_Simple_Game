# Java_Simple_Game

This is a simple game made back 2 years ago when I was still terrible at coding (yes...laugh at you will).
I am still in the phase of learning how to code, yet I thought I'd share one of my first actual projects 
from my school (this one in which I worked with a team of other students). You will notice from the source
code, that there are some poor design choices, but keep in mind this was 2 years ago, things have changed 
I swear! Feel free to look at it and point to our mistakes in this code. All changes, comments, insults are 
welcome :3
